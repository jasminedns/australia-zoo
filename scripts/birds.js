                  The largest cassowaries can stand as high as six feet and weigh up to 160 pounds. 
                  These large birds cannot fly, but their extremely powerful legs propel them at great speeds. 
                  They are strong swimmers and can move quickly on both land and water. Cassowaries are shy and 
                  they are usually hard to spot, at least in their natural rain forest habitats. 
                  They are not overly aggressive, and attacks are rare. But they can do a lot of damage 
                  if they are provoked or angered. Cassowary attacks have occasionally been deadly, including 
                  a recent one which occurred in 2019, at a private collection of caged birds in Florida.`,

                  member of the Kingfisher family, with females weighing up to one pound and growing to 43 cm 
                  in length. Its beak can reach 10 cm long and is used to snatch a variety of invertebrates and 
                  small vertebrates, including the occasional small snake. Since being introduced in western Australia 
                  and New Zealand, the kookaburra has angered farmers by preying on their fowl. 
                  The laughing kookaburra has dark brown wing plumage and a white head and underside. 
                  Dark brown eye stripes run across its face and its upper bill is black. 
                  Its reddish-coloured tail is patterned with black bars.`,

                  it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band. The body feathers are edged 
                  with yellow giving a scalloped appearance. The adult male has a black beak and pinkish-red 
                  eye-rings, and the female has a bone-coloured beak and grey eye-rings. In flight, yellow-tailed 
                  black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly, with a peculiar heavy fluid motion. Their loud, 
                  wailing calls carry for long distances. The whiteae is found south of Victoria to the East 
                  of South Australia and is smaller in size. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found in 
                  temperate forests and forested areas across south and central eastern Queensland to 
                  southeastern South Australia, including a very small population persisting in the Eyre Peninsula.`,
